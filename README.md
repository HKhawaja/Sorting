# Sorting
In this project, I wrote implementations of Merge Sort (recursive and iterative), Quicksort (fixed and random pivot) and Selection Sort.

The purpose of the project was to analyse the real-time differences between the different sorting algorithms due to asymptotics and the size and pattern of the input.
